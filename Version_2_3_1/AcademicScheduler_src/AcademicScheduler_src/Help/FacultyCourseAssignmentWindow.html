<H5 class=TitleUnd>Faculty/Course Assignment Window</H5>

<P>
The Faculty/Course Assignment window is the hub of the program.  In the first stage of scheduling courses are dragged from the course list window to this window and then in the second stage the courses are dragged from this window to the room viewers to place the courses into rooms and times.

<UL class="IndentList">
<LI>The layout of this view is each faculty member is listed, the courses assigned to them are below and indented.  

<LI>The status column shows the course scheduling progress for each course, red means that the course has no rooms and times, yellow means that it is partially scheduled, but it needs some more minutes, dark green means that it is scheduled for the correct amount of time, and finally light green means that it is over scheduled.

<LI>The details column for a professor shows the professor's workload.  The first number is the number of workload hours and the second is the fraction of annual load.  If a professor has tentative courses assigned to them the same is true for the tentative hours and annual load fraction. In the example above, Martha Jones has 5 hours to her load as well as 5 hours that are currently for tentative classes.  The fractions listed are for a 24-hour annual load.

<LI>The details column for a class contains a list of rooms and timeslots the course is scheduled for. 

<LI>Tentative courses are rendered in gray and italics. 

<LI>If yow double-click a course the course information dialog will appear with the particular course loaded. The workings of the course information dialog are discussed in its own section.

<P>
Most reports have two ways to view them, either as a document or as a table.  The document format is really an HTML webpage.  Document format allows the user to print the report to a printer or to export it to a PDF file.  The table format allows the user to copy the report to the system clipboard as a tab delimited string that can be pasted into nearly any spreadsheet.

<LI><B>Merge Report</B>: The merge report displays additions and conflicts in the merging two schedules. This should be done before the user does a merge of schedules.

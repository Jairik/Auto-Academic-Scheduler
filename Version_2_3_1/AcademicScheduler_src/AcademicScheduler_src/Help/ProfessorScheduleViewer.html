<H5 class=TitleUnd>Professor Schedule Viewer</H5>

<P>
The professor schedule viewer is not as functional as the room viewer as it does not allow drag and drop, but it is convenient to have visible while scheduling to make sure that the individual's schedule matches their needs and does not make their work week unmanageable, for example inadvertently giving them four classes in a row.

<UL class="IndentList">
<LI>The layout of this view is each professor is listed on the right, the courses assigned to that professor are below and in the list at the bottom and the weekly schedule area shows the layout of the courses for that professor listing the course, section, and room.  The title bar shows the professor's name and short designation.

<LI>The color of the box containing the course uses the same color codes that are in the status column of the Course/Faculty Assignments window. Red for unscheduled,  yellow for partially scheduled, green for fully scheduled and light green for over-scheduled. 

<LI>Tentative courses are rendered in gray and italics. 

<LI>If you double-click on a room the room editor will be invoked to edit the properties of the room. 

<LI>If yow double-click a course either in the listing at the bottom or on the weekly viewer the course information dialog will appear with the particular course loaded. In addition, a Ctrl+Click on a course in the weekly viewer will do the same.  The workings of the course information dialog are discussed in its own section.

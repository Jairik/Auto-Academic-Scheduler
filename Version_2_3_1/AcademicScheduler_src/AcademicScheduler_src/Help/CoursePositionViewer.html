<H5 class=TitleUnd>Course Position Viewer</H5>

<P>
The course position viewer is simply a viewer with no course alteration functionality.  When the user selects the courses from the list on the right the positions of the union of the course list is graphed in the weekly viewer.  Places where there are no overlaps are in green and overlaps are in different colors depending on the view options you select.  The status bar shows the courses the mouse is hovering over.  In the case of overlaps the status bar shows all the classes that are being hovered over.  This viewer is useful for determining if there are key classes that overlap and should not.  It also shows the user the spread of classes through the week to see if there are enough different times for students to enroll.
